# CSVreader-demo

This is a demo of a class that can read and process a csv file whose first row is column headers.  All other cells are data.

The java file is a Selenium program that will use that class to read in a csv file and input and submit that data on a web form.

In order to run the java program, you will need to download and include the CSVreader jar file and include it in the build path.
